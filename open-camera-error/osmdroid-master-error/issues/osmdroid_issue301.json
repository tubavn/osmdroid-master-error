Use the app so some tiles will be downloaded and then saved to filesystem.\r\n3. That folder can't be changed from API, plus it's not  the default cache folder.\r\n\r\n<b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>\nOSMdroid has a hard-coded property for the external storage directory.\r\nIt should be a parameter or at least a method to be overwritten.\r\nAlso, the default folder could use getExternalCacheDir() or equivalent, so the cache folder would be gone when uninstalling.\r\n\r\n<b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>\n3.0.6, Android 2.2 \r\n\r\n",
