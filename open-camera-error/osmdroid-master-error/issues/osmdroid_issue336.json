I expect many applications (including mine, for sure) will not want to have a shared directory for maps.  OpenStreetMapTileProviderConstants.OSMDROID_PATH sets this directory as a public static final.  Perhaps this could be overridden as one of the MapView constructor AttributeSet parameter items. \r\n",
