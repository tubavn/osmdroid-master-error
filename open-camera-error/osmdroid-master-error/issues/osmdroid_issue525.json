From this perspective one could always scale the tile images to dip (device independent pixels) with no option to change this behaviour.{/IMHO}\r\n\r\n(I'm using osmdroid 4.1 on Android 4.0.4 and 4.4)\r\n\r\nSee also http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7240568/osmdroid-display-tiles-bigger\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
