B is closed with finish() and extra memory clearing calls:\r\n\r\nmMapView.getController().stopAnimation(false);\r\nmMapView.getController().stopPanning();\t\t\r\ntileProvider.clearTileCache();\r\nrl.removeView(mMapView);\r\n\t\t\t\r\nmMapView = null;\r\nrl = null;\r\ntileProvider = null;\r\n\r\n<b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>\n\r\nThe problem is that currently there is no option to clear up BitmapPool, which leaves in memory ca. 5MB extra waste,\r\n\r\n<b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>\n\r\nosmdroid SVN r1393, Android 4.0.\r\n\r\n<b>Please provide any additional information below.</b>\n\r\nBitmapPool memory could be released with the following code:\r\n\r\n\tpublic static void clearCache() {\r\n\t\tif (sInstance != null) {\r\n\t\t\tsynchronized(sInstance.mPool) {\r\n\t\t\t\twhile (!sInstance.mPool.isEmpty()) {\r\n\t\t\t\t\tBitmap bitmap = sInstance.mPool.remove();\r\n\t\t\t\t\tbitmap.recycle();\r\n\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\tsInstance = null;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}",

This leads to the fact that the memory of bitmap pool is not reclaimed when activity is destroyed.\r\nWouldn't it be better to bind BitmapTool to instance of MapView, or to the context of activity?\r\n\r\nMemory of the tile cache also requires to be reclaimed manually due to static instances of tile sources.
