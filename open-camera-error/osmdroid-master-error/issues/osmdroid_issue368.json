It allows for bigger tile caches and more importantly it can cut down on GCs (which osmdroid produces a lot of).\r\n\r\nSo let's change the loading tile and all Bitmaps created by the rescaleCache() method from ARGB_8888 (32-bit) to RGB_565 (16-bit no alpha). It will produce smaller bitmaps and cause less GCs.",
