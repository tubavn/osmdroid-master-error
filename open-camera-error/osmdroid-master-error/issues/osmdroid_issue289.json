I've made no code changes in my app other than the version number. I've built the project using the latest SDK tools (r16) and Ant on a Windows 64 bit machine. I've downloaded a release version on to a Galaxy S2 running  Android 2.3.5 \r\n<b>2.</b>\n<b>3.</b>\n\r\n<b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>\n\r\nI expected the smooth loading of tiles as with previous versions of the jar. As I zoom and pan the map, the tile loading is very 'blocky' and slow compared to the 3.0.5 build. Sometimes the tiles do not appear at all. I rebuilt the app with 3.0.5 and tested again - it's fine.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>\n\r\nosmdroid-android-3.0.6.jar, real phone running 2.3.5 Android, Wifi connection through ADSL router\r\n\r\n<b>Please provide any additional information below.</b>\n\r\nI'll try and build a minimal code example to test on an emulator when I get a chance\r\n\r\n",
