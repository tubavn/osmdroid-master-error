Sorry.\r\n\r\nSo I took the code I have and added:\r\n\r\nMapController mMapController = mapView.getController();\r\nmMapController.setZoom(13);\r\nGeoPoint gPt = new GeoPoint(51500000, -150000);\r\n//Centre map near to Hyde Park Corner, London\r\nmMapController.setCenter(gPt);\r\n\r\nAnd I still have the same symptoms, works fine on 2.1 but no tiles appear in 4.0.3.\r\n\r\nThe code I have is really very simple, hopefully it's a good test case? (I'm not sure what you mean by \"basically the same code\"?)\r\n\r\nThe only difference I can see is you haven't called setMultiTouchControls(true); but I tried removing that and it still happens.\r\n\r\nThanks for looking at this,\r\nJames\r\n",
