This looks a little bit overengineered for this tiny piece of code.\r\n\r\nA possible solution, which could be acceptable, is to integrate the stuff like in the\r\nfirst version and always build with the latest SDK.\r\n\r\nThen, check Build.Version \r\nhttp://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Build.VERSION.html#SDK_INT\r\nagainst the version code \r\nhttp://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Build.VERSION_CODES.html\r\nand do not enter the code where the later method unavailable on the current version\r\ncould be used. The overhead should be small.\r\n\r\nBy looking for the Build.VERSION in the code, you can easily trace the parts, which\r\nare version dependend.\r\n\r\nIMHO this would make enhancements easier without the necessity use a split code base.\r\nWhat do you think about this solution? \r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nThomas\r\n \r\n\r\n",
