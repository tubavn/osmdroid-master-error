What do you see instead?</b>\n\r\nI would expect the see the size of the overlay properly adjust to the title or the description,\r\nwhichever is longer.  What I see instead is that it always adjusts to the description length.\r\n\r\nThis is as of revision 494.\r\n\r\n<b>Please provide any additional information below.</b>\n\r\nThe problem is that on line 230 of OpenStreetMapViewItemizedOverlayWithFocus, it supposed to be measuring the text width of the title, but it is measuring the text width of the description instead.  Changing the line to read:\r\n\r\nfinal int titleWidth = (int) this.mTitlePaint.measureText(itemTitle);\r\n\r\nwill fix this problem.",
