Trim the projection down to the basics:\r\n   a. fromPixels (Google API - already implemented)\r\n   b. toPixels (Google API - right now we call this toMapPixels)\r\n   c. metersToEquatorPixels - (Google API - already implemented albeit slightly incorrectly since it uses latitude 0.0 instead of on-screen latitude)\r\n   d. fromPixelsProjected\r\n   e. toPixelsProjected\r\n   f. toPixelsFromMotionEvent (new method - used to correctly go from MotionEvent to on-screen pixels)\r\n   g. getZoomLevel, getBoundingBox, getScreenRect (not intrinsic), getMapOrientation()\r\n\r\n2. Move the projection into its own file. See issue 414.\r\n\r\n3. We can move all the &quot;extra&quot; methods into a subclass of the Projection class (ProjectionExtended perhaps?).\r\n",
