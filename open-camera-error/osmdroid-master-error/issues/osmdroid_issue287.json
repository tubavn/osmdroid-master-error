What do you see instead?</b>\nexpect the two lat lon's to be the same, the second lat lon seems to be based on my current screenrect and very different\r\n\r\n<b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>\n3.0.5 jar\r\n\r\n<b>Please provide any additional information below.</b>\nThe docs say that toPixels goes from geopoint to screen coordinates, and that fromPixels goes from screen coordinates to geopoint.  It seems then that you should be able to go straight from a geopoint to pixels and back and end up with the same point.  \r\n\r\nI think two things would help: the current function fromPixels should have the name changed and the docs changed to more accurately describe what it does (not completely sure what that is though so i can't help) and then create a second function called fromPixels that operates independently of the screenrect.\r\n",
