    "content" : "I've done some improvements to the ScaleBar which might be useful for others as well:\r\n- adjust the displayed bar length so that it reflects a rounded distance starting with 1, 2 or 5 instead of displaying a fractional length. This works for metrical, imperial and nautical units.\r\n- draw the bar centred around the given screen coordinates\r\n- specify a different bar length (default is 1 inch)\r\n- add a background to the bar to make it stand out better\r\n\r\nAll changes have been done in a way to maintain the previous behaviour if used in the same way.\r\n\r\nThe attached patch also contains the patch for issue 373.",
