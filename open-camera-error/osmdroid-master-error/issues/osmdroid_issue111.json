Update the map with JOSM or potlatch\r\n4. You still see the old, obsolete tiles\r\n\r\n<b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>\nThere should be an option to reload the currently visible tiles, as suggested in issue 40 and issue 44.\r\n\r\n<b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>\nCurrent svn (r454), android 2.1\r\n\r\n<b>Please provide any additional information below.</b>\nThis patch provides a new method OpenStreetMapView.removeCachedVisibleTiles , and a menu option in the OpenStreetMapViewer sample to call that method.\r\n\r\nThe method calls cache and filesystem methods to remove the tiles in a given rectangle at several zoom levels.\r\n\r\nPlease review and let me know what you think.\r\n\r\nMany thanks,\r\n-Jeremy Monin\r\n",
