Perhaps I could add a sample similar to the other samples, or someone else could do that.\r\n\r\nI think it would be better if you could remove the parameter numberOfPoints and let the method calculate how many points it needs without the caller having to calculate it. That should be easy enough - just copy the code that you had in your sample.",
