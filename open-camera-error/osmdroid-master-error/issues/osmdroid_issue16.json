What do you see instead?</b>\nThe viewed map region should be loaded first.\r\nIt seems that the map tiles are loaded in the order they are first viewed.\r\nThis means that te currently viewed map tile is shown last and needs the\r\nmaximum time to show up\r\n\r\n<b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>\nVersion 1.1 on Motorola Milestone\r\n\r\n\r\n",
