What do you see instead?</b>\nzoom should work at a reasonable speed, in my case it takes 5 minutes to complete leading to ANR errors.\r\n\r\n<b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>\n3.0.7 wavefront codee revision 1080\r\n\r\n<b>Please provide any additional information below.</b>\n\r\nThe problem is the TileCache rescaling code.  zooming out 10 level it tries to iterate though 1024*1024 tiles, on my device this takes about 5 minutes if you let it continue.\r\nI propose a simple fix of restricting the number of zoom levels out the rescaleing will happen for. The attachd version of the code restricts rescaling to a max of 4 levels.\r\n\r\n",
