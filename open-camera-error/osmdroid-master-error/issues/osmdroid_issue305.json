    "content" : "Hi,\r\n\r\nI just tried to upgrade my app (http://osmtracker-android.googlecode.com) from v3.0.1 to the latest v3.0.7 and encountered an few issues.\r\n\r\nThe first one has to do with SimpleLocationOverlay.\r\n\r\nI was using the default &quot;person.png&quot; bitmap that comes in the JAR and with v3.0.7 creating a new SimpleLocationOverlay throws an exception with &quot;Resource not found: person.png&quot;.\r\n\r\nLooking at the DefaultResourceProxyImpl class the bitmap is loaded with getClass().getResourceAsStream() with a relative path (&quot;person.jpg&quot;). I believe that means that the resource is relative to the current package (org/osmdroid/person.png), whereas it should be an absolute URL: getResourceAsStream(&quot;/person.png&quot;).\r\n\r\nI've changed that to add a leading slash in my local copy and it doesn't throw an exception anymore.\r\nI'm surprised that this issue didn't arise before since I suspect the DefaultResrouceProxyImpl is used everywhere ? Maybe it's an environment thing or related to changes in the ClassLoader and how it resolves resources in Android ? I'm using Android 1.6.\r\n\r\nThe second issue is that the MapView doesn't display anything after the upgrade :) I just get a full black screen. All I can see is that some tiles are downloaded on the SD card under /osmdroid/tiles/Mapnik/17/65535 and 65536 folders, which looks suspicious !\r\n\r\nDo you have any idea of what could cause that, or what would be the best way to debug the issue ?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nNico\r\n",
