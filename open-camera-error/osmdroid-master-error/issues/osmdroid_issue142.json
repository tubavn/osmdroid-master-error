Start the app and run trace to profile the method calls\r\n\r\n<b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>\nI expect the app to start quickly. I see a long black screen of blocked\r\n app.\r\n\r\n<b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>\nosmdroid 1.10 in open gps tracker 0.9.24 on a stock froyo nexus one\r\n\r\n<b>Please provide any additional information below.</b>\n\r\nThe call to File.listFiles() in OpenStreetMapTileFilesystemProvider.calculateDirectorySize() blocks the main thread a lot. \r\n\r\nhttp://code.google.com/p/osmdroid/source/browse/trunk/osmdroid-android/src/org/andnav/osm/tileprovider/OpenStreetMapTileFilesystemProvider.java\r\n\r\nThe workaround is to delete /sdcard/osmdroid when things get to slow.\r\n\r\nI've attached the traceview I took during a start will my app had a black blocking screen.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
