Enter half of what the scale bar shows.\r\n\r\n<b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>\nThe resulting circle's diameter should match the length of the scale bar. Instead, the circle is much smaller.\r\n\r\n<b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>\nI'm using a patched version of osmdroid (jar included), the patch's only change being changing a method of ScaleBarOverlay from private to protected to show the actual length in meters.",

I realise you copied that code from MyLocationOverlay, which means that code is wrong. I think MyLocationOverlay uses the distance at the equator, whereas ScaleBarOverlay uses the distance at your location. Perhaps you'd like to submit a patch for MyLocationOverlay :-)",
