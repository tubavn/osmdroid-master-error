Start the app and check the child view is draw correctly.\r\n3. Zoom in. \r\n\r\n<b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>\nThe child view should be redrawn when zooming in. Instead the child view disappears and is no longer drawn. If you later call osmMapView.removeAllViews() and osmMapView.add(customView) then the view appears again.\r\n\r\n<b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>\nThe bug occurs with 3.0.3 and 3.0.5. The bug does not occur when the Google Maps API is being used instead of OSMDroid.\r\n\r\nHelp!\r\n",
