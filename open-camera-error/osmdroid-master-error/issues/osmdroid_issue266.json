When the user scrolls beyond the boundaries of the city map it will just display a grey empty screen. How do I get the total map size of my small map? What I see on my /tiles/Manpik directory are just .png images but when my program runs it shows the map. \r\n\r\nI have seen this existing issue but still I don't have any idea on how to solve the problem: \r\nhttp://code.google.com/p/osmdroid/issues/detail?id=209\r\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/5403733/restricting-the-area-the-user-can-go-to-on-mapview\r\n\r\nI have also checked out the attached files from Issue 209: LimitScrollToGeographicArea.patch, scrollToMethod.txt but I cannot understand how to use patch files, and it is a little bit advance for I am a beginner. I have also tried to implement the class but many errors occurred. As a beginner I need a more understandable codes to implement or classes. Thank you for your support. \r\n",
