What do you see instead?</b>\n2. The map jumps instead of staying centered\r\n\r\nNote that if I zoom and hold it for a while before releasing my fingers, it works perfectly.\r\nI already tried to increase MultiTouchController.EVENT_SETTLE_TIME_INTERVAL but with no success.\r\n\r\nI tried a lot but had no success yet, so I would appreciate every hint/solution.\r\n\r\n",
