    "content" : "Interestingly - this should be handled properly. When zooming in:\r\n\r\n1. The animation starts. The maps stay at the current zoom level.\r\n2. The view increases in scale until it is at 2.0x. The animation ends.\r\n3. The maps call setZoomLevel() to the new zoom level.\r\n4. setZoomLevel() halts all panning animation where it is at.\r\n5. setZoomLevel() adjusts the scroll position for the new zoom level.\r\n\r\nSo what *should* happen in the situation you describe is something along the lines of:\r\n1. The onLocationChanged() fires, and the maps start to pan towards your current location.\r\n2. During the animation you tap the zoom-in button.\r\n3. The scroller stops panning where it is at.\r\n4. The maps zoom in.\r\n5. You end up half-way in between your starting location and your destination location.\r\n\r\nBut it sounds like you end up completely in the wrong location that isn't along the path between your starting and destination location correct? That sounds like the scroll values are not getting translated from the old zoom level to the new zoom level, but it could be something else.\r\n\r\nI wonder if you remove lines 979 and 981 from MapView.computeScroll():\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tscrollTo(mScroller.getCurrX(), mScroller.getCurrY());\r\n\t\t\t\tsetZoomLevel(mZoomLevel);\r\n\r\nDoes that fix the problem? There is a chance that the last scrollTo() puts those x/y values for the old zoom level into the new zoom level.\r\n\r\n",
