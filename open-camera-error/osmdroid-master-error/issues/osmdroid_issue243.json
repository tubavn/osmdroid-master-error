What do you see instead?</b>\nthe color of the junction point between two section of the itinerary is darker than the color of the section. ref. the picture. \r\n\r\n<b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>\nI use the latest version of osmdroid for android (version 3.0.4), and test it in emulator API 7 (WVGA800).\r\n\r\n<b>Please provide any additional information below.</b>\nI think it is because osmdroid draw all things in the same canvas, the method setXfermode\r\ncan not give me the right result even I write like this in the constructor:\r\nthis.mPaint.setXfermode(new PorterDuffXfermode(PorterDuff.Mode.SRC));\r\n\r\n",
