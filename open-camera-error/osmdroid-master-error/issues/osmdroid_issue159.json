Resolved errors, related to changes in package names / method signatures, etc.\r\n\r\nAfter application started, I just see empty MapView with cells in background. Map tiles are not loaded.\r\nI got the following warnings in LogCat: \r\n02-08 17:45:48.648: WARN/org.osmdroid.tileprovider.modules.MapTileDownloader(1133): Tile not found: /1/0/1 : java.io.FileNotFoundException: http://b.tile.cloudmade.com//1/256/1/0/1.png?token=\r\n\r\nAs you can see, CLOUDMADE_KEY &amp; CLOUDMADE_TOKEN are not present in URL.
