This configuration requires an additional permission (WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE), but more importantly, it goes against the Android data storage design. See https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/data-storage.html\r\n\r\nIf OSMDroid uses getCacheDir() as the cache storage, Android can clear the directory if additional space is required, and the data will be removed when the application is uninstalled.\r\n\r\nIMHO, the SD card should not be used by OSMDroid. But, at the very least, OSMDroid should have a configuration option to use getCacheDir() or the SD card, and default to getCacheDir().",
