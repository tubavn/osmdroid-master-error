Using DDMS i found out it was due to a call to &quot;enableMyLocation&quot;.\r\nHere are my steps to detect the problem.\r\n\r\n<b>What steps will reproduce the problem?</b>\n1. Create an activity with an instance of MyLocationNewOverlay calling enableMyLocation (in onCreate)\r\n\r\n2. Create two other activities (1 before, 1 after) in order to have a story board\r\n\r\n3. Moving from 1-&gt;2-&gt;3 3-&gt;2-1, catching memory usage using DDMS, moving again 1-&gt;2-&gt;3 3-&gt;2-&gt;1, Boom, memory has increased.\r\n\r\n4. Disable &quot;enableMyLocation&quot; and repeating step3, memory hasn't increased this time.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>\n\r\nOSMDroid 4.2 Android 4.1.2 on a Galaxy Note 10.1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
