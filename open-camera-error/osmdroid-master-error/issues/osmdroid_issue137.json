And for opensourcing andnav.\r\n\r\nThe org.andnav and org.osmdroid share many almost identical sources files.\r\nSome are just prefixed by OpenStreetMap.\r\n\r\neg: geopoint.java or mymath.java and many many more.\r\nDid i break something ?\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the way, downloading the jar file 1.10, I discovered that it was missing all osmdroid specific files. Is it normal too ?!\r\n\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nSimon Th√©pot",
