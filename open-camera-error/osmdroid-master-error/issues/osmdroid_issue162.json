While the current tiles for the area are downloading, switch to a different map type.\r\n3. Pending requests for tiles of the previous map type would eventually finish but the tiles would be added to the new map type's cache.\r\n4. Resulting in tiles of mixed types displayed in MapView. \r\n\r\nSee the attached picture.\r\n\r\n<b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>\nOpenStreetMap Viewer 3.0.1\r\n\r\nIt is easier to spot when using slow data connection eg. EDGE.\r\n",
