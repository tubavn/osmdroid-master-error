Can I register Location updates in the program ... and does this not have a negative effect on the MyLocationManager? \r\n\r\nSo e.g. locationManager.requestLocationUpdates(LocationManager.GPS_PROVIDER,\r\n            3000, 0, gpsLocationListener);\r\n\r\nI don't want to interfere with the location updates the MyLocationOverlay needs to redraw the location etc. \r\n\r\nI know there is also a MyLocationOverlay.onLocationChanged(). Can I use that one? Via inheriting? \r\n\r\n",
