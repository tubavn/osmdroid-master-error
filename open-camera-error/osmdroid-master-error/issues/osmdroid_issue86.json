However, it appears that there is no way to provide our own via the public constructors in OpenStreetMapView.\r\n\r\nA simple solution would be to add this constructor:\r\n\r\n\tpublic OpenStreetMapView(final Context context, final OpenStreetMapRendererInfo aRendererInfo, OpenStreetMapTileProvider provider)\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tthis(context, null, aRendererInfo, provider);\r\n\t}\r\n\r\nCould you please add this constructor to the code?\r\n(unless there is some other way to do it already that I don't see)\r\n\r\nThanks!",
