It calls all overlays with shadow = true first, then all overlays with shadow = false afterwards.\r\n\r\nI am submitting this issue to suggest that we change osmdroid to work the same way as Google.\r\n\r\nI've attached a patch which seems to work.\r\n\r\nThis issue is derived from some comments on issue 155.",

The reason we called onManagedDraw is so that we could short-circuit calling onDraw if !mEnabled. However, this functionality can easily be handled by the OverlayManager, and I'll note in the comments that the \"enabled\" functionality must be checked externally before calling onDraw.",
