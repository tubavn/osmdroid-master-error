What do you see instead?</b>\nThe zoom levels will not be restricted and I can still zoom into levels that I did not download the maptiles for.\r\n\r\n<b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>\n\r\nI am doing this on Android Mobile, and I have tested from Android OS 2.3 - 4.1 and all doesn't work for restricting zoom level.\r\n\r\n",
