I know that's hard when the patches start to pile up and we haven't had time to integrate them. We appreciate your patience.\r\n\r\nAs Neil suggested, this is best broken up into separate patches. I have spun three patches out of your changes:\r\n\r\n1. Adding try/finally blocks around locking operations.\r\n\r\n2. Implementing HttpClient in the tile downloader\r\n\r\n3. Switching to an Executor/thread pool\r\n\r\nI wasn't too clear on some of the other changes, so if you think they should be considered, please resubmit as a separate patch.\r\n\r\nI am going to apply #1 right away, and spin #2 and #3 off as separate tickets since they are significant changes.",
