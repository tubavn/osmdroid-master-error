Turn the device into flight mode (no network connectivity)\r\n4. Close and reopen your app : previous saved tiles are not displayed\r\nThese steps put in an obvious place the issue, but in common usage the filesystem cache is never used to load MapQuestOSM tiles.\r\n\r\n<b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>\nTiles available on the sdcard should be displayed and not downloaded.\r\n\r\n<b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>\nosmdroid-android jar 3.0.1\r\n\r\n<b>Please provide any additional information below.</b>\nThe problem seems to be located in MapTileProviderBasic, line 51 : \r\n\r\nfinal MapTileFilesystemProvider fileSystemProvider = new MapTileFilesystemProvider(\r\n\t\t\t\tpRegisterReceiver);\r\n\r\nWe should do :\r\n\r\nfinal MapTileFilesystemProvider fileSystemProvider = new MapTileFilesystemProvider(\r\n\t\t\t\tpRegisterReceiver, pTileSource);",
