Add MyLocationOverlay to map\r\n2. enable location updates to be drawn\r\n3. call disableMyLocation() to stop location updates\r\n\r\n<b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>\nMyLocationOverlay should stop drawing the location, but it still does draw the latest location it has received.\r\n\r\n<b>What version of the product are you using?
