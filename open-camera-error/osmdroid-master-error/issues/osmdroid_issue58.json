What do you see instead?</b>\nThe on-screen zoom controls will zoom based on what they last remembered the \r\nzoom as being, not the actual current zoom level.\r\n\r\nOnly one of OpenStreetMapView or OpenStreetMapViewController should remember \r\nthe zoom level, ie only one of them should have mZoomLevel. They can ask each \r\nother for the current value.",
