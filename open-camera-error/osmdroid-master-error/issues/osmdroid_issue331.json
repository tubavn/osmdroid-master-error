What do you see instead?</b>\nOn Phones with different resolution densities(I tested hdpi(motodefy) and ldpi(xperia 10 mini pro)) the markers should be about the same size.\r\n\r\nInstead i see that on ldpi-phones all markers are displayed far too small on the screen and on hdpi-phones markers are really big. When I subclassed ItemizedOverlayWithFocus and Overrode the boundToHotspot() method, so that mScale would be ignored, all markers were displayed in a reasonable size.\r\n\r\n<b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>\nI'm using osmdroid 3.0.7 on Android 2.1 and 2.2\r\n\r\n",
