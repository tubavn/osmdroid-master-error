This seems to improve the download \r\nspeed enormously. Checking the URLs in parallel with a Firefox sometimes shows a 404 \r\non some tiles, indicating a server problem which is harmless, if you can try lots of \r\nservers.\r\n\r\nRoom for improvement, choose the servers according to their response time... \r\n\r\nThe cyclemap now feels better than the Google maps!",
