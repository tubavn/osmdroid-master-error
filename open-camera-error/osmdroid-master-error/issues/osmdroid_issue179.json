What do you see instead?</b>\nI expect that the project still compiles. Instead, I see errors.\r\n\r\n<b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>\nTrunk on Android 1.5.\r\n\r\n<b>Please provide any additional information below.</b>\nreplacing followLocation(boolean) with enableFollowLocation() and disableFollowLocation() without adding\r\npublic void followLocation(boolean follow) {\r\n  if(follow) enableFollowLocation(); else disableFollowLocation();\r\n}\r\nis just rude.
