What do you see instead?</b>\n\r\nHello everybody, I from Russia and badly speak English. I have a problem with a map marker. at the density of the Hdpi 320 screen (standard) my tags of the map become biger then standard osm tags. standard osm tags look well ,but when i use my own images they looks awful (look in attachment). \r\n\r\n<b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>\n\r\nI use OSM 3.0.8 library and an api android slf4j-android-1.6.1-RC1 package\r\n\r\n\r\n",
