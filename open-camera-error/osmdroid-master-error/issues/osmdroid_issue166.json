It's nice to have overlays of lots of different types, but these three new ones are very similar to the original fiets overlay, so I'm not sure if it's adding much to osmdroid.  If you're able to use these overlays by just defining them in your own project, perhaps that's the way to go. I'd be interested in other people's opinions though.",
