What do you see instead?</b>\nI expect, that the map occurs zoomed to given span. Nothing happens instead.\r\n\r\n<b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>\n1.0.9\r\n\r\n<b>Please provide any additional information below.</b>\nWe looked in source code of zoomToSpan and saw the problem.\r\nIf you call zoomToSpan, this method calls getVisibleBoundingBoxE6() to know, if map should be zoomed in or to zoomed out. But by calling zoomToSpan in onCreate the visible bounding box has zero coordinates\r\n\r\nSo long,\r\n\r\nMur",
