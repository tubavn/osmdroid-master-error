We have not changed anything in the osmdroid code (using the jar file 3.0.10)\r\n3. The zip contains the tiles till zoom level 17.\r\n4. Thats why we are trying to set max zoom level to 17 using setMaxZoomLevel API introduced recently.\r\n5 When we do that, the tiles disappear because then it tries to seek the tiles for different x and y (compared to those when we do not use this API )\r\n6. When we dont call this API then the values of x and y are correct and the tiles are picked up from the zip file.\r\n\r\nThanx ",
