Set MapView.getController().setCenter(point)\r\n2. set MapView.getController().animateTo(point)\r\n3. set MapView.getController().setZoom(point) //It doesn't matter where it goes, before or after setCenter\r\n\r\n<b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>\nI expected to see the point set as center, instead of that I see the low-left corner of the image used as map\r\n\r\n<b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>\nandroid 2.3.6 using osmdroid-android-3.0.8.jar and slf4j-android-1.5.8.jar\r\n\r\n<b>Please provide any additional information below.</b>\nI'm working with custom overlay, but it doesn't animate to the point or even show the point set alone whith a GeoPoint either.\r\n",
