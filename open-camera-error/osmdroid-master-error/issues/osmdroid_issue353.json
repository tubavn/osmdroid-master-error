    "content" : "When Running OSMDROID on low Performance Phones with small RAM like HTC Wildfire i get OutOfMemory Exceptions and some tiles wont be displayed.\r\nIt seems that the Bitmap Memory runns full on all Android 2.x Devices.\r\n\r\nThe error hits also Android 4.x Devices but without Exceptions in the Log. All Tiles are loaded from Network or the inside osm cache.\r\n\r\nI know that my App consume some dalvik-heap memory and bitmap memory too. But maybe how that can be optimized in OSM-DROID ?\r\n\r\nSometimes the erro occures and sometimes not. When i change zomm level the tiles lower could be loaded. I will try to append an Example Tomorrow.\r\n\r\nUsing OSM-DROID Repository Version r1103.\r\n",

Sometimes the map has a lot of black tiles.\r\nAnd even when i move arround the map and go back to where a tile was black befor. The same tile will be shown an black.\r\n\r\nI think it could be an caching Problem. Or an error in Zooming In and out.\r\n\r\nAny other Ideas ?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
