    "content" : "Adding a MapBoxTileSource was a great idea. \r\nHowever, the current implementation has the following issues:\r\n\r\n1) Default zoom max level = 20 is too high. At this level, it shows empty tiles with just a cross. Should be 19. \r\n\r\n2) Handling of MapBox map ID with retrieveMapBoxMapId is not good. MapBox can provide various types of maps (satellite, satellite labelled,...). \r\nNo way to handle more than 1 map type in an application, even using the &quot;full-featured&quot; constructor. \r\n\r\nI would suggest to change the default constructor, to pass it the map ID. \r\nAnd to avoid various map types mixed in the same caching area, we also have to pass a user-defined name. \r\n\r\npublic MapBoxTileSource(String name, String aMapBoxMapId)\r\n{\r\n  mapBoxMapId = aMapBoxMapId;\r\n  super(name, ResourceProxy.string.base, 1, 19, 256, &quot;.png&quot;, mapBoxBaseUrl);\r\n}\r\n\r\nThe caller can then create it for instance this way:\r\nOnlineTileSourceBase myMBSatTileSource = new MapBoxTileSource(\r\n  &quot;MapBoxSatellite&quot;, \r\n  ManifestUtil.retrieveKey(this, &quot;MAPBOX_SAT_MAPID&quot;));\r\n\r\n\r\n3) It's using this base url &quot;http://api.tiles.mapbox.com/v3/&quot;\r\n=&gt; It doesn't use the usual &quot;farming&quot; mechanism: \r\n&quot;http://a.tiles.mapbox.com/v3/&quot;, \r\n&quot;http://b.tiles.mapbox.com/v3/&quot;,\r\n&quot;http://c.tiles.mapbox.com/v3/&quot;, \r\n&quot;http://d.tiles.mapbox.com/v3/&quot;\r\nNot sure if it's a potential issue or not. \r\n\r\n4) It's using this resourceId: ResourceProxy.string.base, which is also the id of BASE tile source (http://topo.openstreetmap.de/base/), and used at various places in osmdroid. \r\nStrange, but again, not sure if it's a potential issue or not. \r\n",
