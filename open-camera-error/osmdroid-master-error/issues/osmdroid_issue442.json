This is causing a lot of confusion with users who errantly set the clickable property.\r\n\r\nI have been trying the following solution in MapView, and it appears to be working well for me:\r\n\r\n\t@Override\r\n\tpublic boolean onTouchEvent(MotionEvent event) {\r\n\t\treturn false;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\nThis will prevent the MapView itself from consuming touch events, even if setClickable is true. Child views to the MapView can still receive touch events, multi-touch works, overlay touches work, etc...\r\n\r\nI am going to commit the fix. Please report any issues to this ticket.",
