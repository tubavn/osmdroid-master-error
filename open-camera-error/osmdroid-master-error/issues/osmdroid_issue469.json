Zoom in at the maximum Zoomlevel of the tilesource (Online Tile Source, pngs, mapnik)\r\n3. We can't read the names of some locations because they are so small.\r\n\r\n<b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>\nIt should be possible to zoom in, when we reached the maximum zoomlevel of the Tile Source, tiles should be loaded from the previous zoomlevel and scaled up.",
