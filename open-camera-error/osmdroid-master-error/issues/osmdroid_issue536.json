    "content" : "I have created an offline .mbtiles file with transparent tiles in it. I place this file in the osmdroid directory on the SD-card and when is start my app, the mbtiles are loaded on top of my base-map. However: there is no transparency, so the background is rendered gray.\r\n\r\nIs it possible to make MBTilesFileArchive render tiles with transparency just like tilesoruces does?\r\n\r\n<b>What steps will reproduce the problem?</b>\n1. Put .mbtiles file with transparency in OSMDroid directory \r\n2. Start map\r\n\r\n<b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>\nThe transparent regions are displayed gray; I expected that they were transparent so i could see the underlaying tilesource.\r\n\r\n<b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>\nVersion 4.0, Android 4.4.2 KitKat\r\n\r\n",
