Zoom In with builtin controls\r\n\r\n<b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>\n\r\nYou should zoom in and center of map should remain in center.\r\nZooming out is fine, Zooming in centers map incorrectly.\r\n\r\nFrom where I am, NY State, the scale animation works okay, but then ends with a scroll to a coordinate in the South Atlantic near Gabon!\r\n\r\n<b>What version of the product are you using?
