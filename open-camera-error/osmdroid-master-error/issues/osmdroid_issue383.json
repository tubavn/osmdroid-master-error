    "content" : "The MyLocationOverlay class has been kicking around since 2008. It has grown to add a lot of functionality but it has become a mess. I'd like to do the following:\r\n\r\n1. Split the overlay into two separate overlays - one to handle the MyLocation stuff and one to handle the Compass stuff.\r\n2. Make the location data (for MyLocation) and bearing data (for Compass) be provided by an interface to make it much more modular. Implement the two current data providers - GPS for MyLocation and internal compass sensor for Compass.\r\n\r\nEssentially the new classes would have the same functionality while being much more extensible and cleaner.",

Right now the mPersonBitmap and mDirectionArrowBitmap are protected but also final.\r\n\r\nThanks.",
