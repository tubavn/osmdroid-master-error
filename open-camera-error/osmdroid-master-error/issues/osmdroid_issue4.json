Basically it will always draw a line from the point \r\nof origin (0,0) to the first point because the first point is not entered \r\ncorrectly. Fixing it is trivial and involves only moving the increment \r\noperation further down the loop so that the first point will be entered \r\nwith moveTo rather than drawLine. Patch is attached.\r\n\r\nHTH\r\n\r\nLudwig\r\n\r\n\r\n",
