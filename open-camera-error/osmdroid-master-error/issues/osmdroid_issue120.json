Watch the one below &quot;steal&quot; events from the one on top\r\n\r\n<b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>\nThe expected behavior is to have the topmost object consume the tap event. Instead, the one at the bottom gets it.\r\n\r\n<b>What version of the product are you using?
