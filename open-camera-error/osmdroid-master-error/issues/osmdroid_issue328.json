The MapView will be constructed using the standard XML two argument constructor which in turn calls the full constructor with defaults filled in. There's no way to override these defaults in a subclass because that constructor is private.\r\n\r\n<b>What is the expected output?

I'd like to subclass MapView and be able to call \r\n\r\nprivate MapView(final Context context, final int tileSizePixels,\r\n                        final ResourceProxy resourceProxy, MapTileProviderBase tileProvider,\r\n                        final Handler tileRequestCompleteHandler, final AttributeSet attrs) ;\r\n\r\nfrom my subclass's constructor. The reason is that the subclass can then use my custom tileprovider/resourceproxy while getting instantiated from a layout XML. I don't see any other way to achieve that currently.",
