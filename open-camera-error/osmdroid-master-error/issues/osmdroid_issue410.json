    "content" : "Ori.klein1 is correct. The tile downloader requires a file cache. When a tile is downloaded it is written to the file cache and then the tile is served by the filesystem provider. If you read issue 207 it explains that this prevents the situation where tiles are downloaded for an area that is now off-screen. Previously this would push out tiles from the memory cache that were on the screen causing the tiles to \"flash\".",
