Define any class that extends OpenStreetMapViewOverlay\r\nUnder the OnDraw Method do the following\r\nget final Rect canvasBounds= canvas.getClipBounds();\r\n\r\ncanvas.drawText(&quot;TEST&quot; , canvasBounds.Right-textWidth-5, canvasBounds.bottom-5-fontSpacing, somePaint);\r\n\r\n2. Layout -\r\n&lt;RelativeLayout fill parent, fill parent&gt;\r\n  &lt;MapView fill parent, fill parent/&gt;\r\n  &lt;RelativeLayout fill parent, fill parent&gt;\r\n     &lt;button background = img1 height=fill parent width=wrap content/&gt;\r\n  &lt;/RelativeLayout&gt;\r\n&lt;/RelativeLayout&gt;\r\n\r\n3. In the map activity, When the button is clicked, have it alternate background images between img1 and img 2 using OnClickListener\r\n\r\n4. Clicking the button causes the overlay(s)(text) to be drawn behind the button\r\n\r\n<b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>\n\r\nSteps above i had the button height fill the parent, So when you click the button the &quot;TEST&quot; text will be easily visible on the bottom part of the screen\r\n\r\n<b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>\n\r\n\r\n<b>Please provide any additional information below.</b>\n Make sure to align the button to the left and the overlay text drawing to the right. So when the button is click, you will see the canvas drawing overlap.\r\n",
