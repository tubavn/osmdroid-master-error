It seems to me that this is something that should be relegated to the Activity that houses the MapView and therefore should be removed from the MapView. For activities that implement this themselves (like MapActivity) the MapView's implementation can actually interfere and override the Activity's implementation and render it useless. Almost every Activity has to implement saving scroll X/Y and zoom level (among other things) in onPause/onResume since onSave/RestoreInstanceState is only called when the Activity is killed, and doesn't cover simply rotating the screen.\r\n\r\nCan we all agree or am I missing something?",
