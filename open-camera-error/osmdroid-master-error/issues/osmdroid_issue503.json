When calling MapView.zoomToBoundingBox with various bounding boxes, the map will always show maxZ, regardless of the actaul size of the bonding box. The center seems to be correct though\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>\nThe map view should adapt its zoom level to show &quot;just&quot; the bounding box, but it remains at its maximum zoom level regardless of the actual bounding box size.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>\nosmdroid 4.0, checked on Android 2.3x, 4.1.x, 4.2x, 4.4.x.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Please provide any additional information below.</b>\n\r\n",
