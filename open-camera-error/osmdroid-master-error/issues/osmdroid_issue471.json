Remove the AbstractAnimationRunner. It accesses MapView UI elements and fields on a background thread and is not thread-safe.\r\n3. Move all the zoom-in/out animation code to the controller and out of the MapView.\r\n4. Let the MapView.getController() return an IMapController so that it can return custom implementations of MapController.\r\n",

This will keep zoom and pinch zoom operations consistent and will eliminate issues where overlay painting will scale when zooming regardless of trying to counteract it in the canvas.\r\nUpdate issue 471\r\nUpdated MapController. Removed unsafe AbstractAnimationRunner code, moved all zoom animation code to MapController.",
