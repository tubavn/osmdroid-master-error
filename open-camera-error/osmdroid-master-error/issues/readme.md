# What's this?

Long time ago, Google offered open source projects a home for code,
issue tracking, etc.

At one point, there was a tool to automagically migrate everything from 
Google's repo into Github. This project (osmdroid) was migrated before 
this tool was available. Although most of the source history was 
persevered, the issue tracker did not.

This directory contains an export of the issue tracker from the old
osmdroid issue tracker.
