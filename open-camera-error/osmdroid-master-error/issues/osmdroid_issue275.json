What do you see instead?</b>\nTo have the marker set with the anchor point in the lower left corner - instead the icon is set somewhere completly wrong\r\n\r\n<b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>\n3.0.6\r\n\r\n<b>Please provide any additional information below.</b>\nItemizedOverlay.java # 277\r\nJust have a look at these 2 cases in code:\r\n\r\n\t\tcase LOWER_RIGHT_CORNER:\r\n\t\t\tmRect.offset(-markerWidth, -markerHeight);\r\n\t\t\tbreak;\r\n\t\tcase LOWER_LEFT_CORNER:\r\n\t\t\tmRect.offset(0, markerHeight); /// TODO test - should this be -markerHeight ???\r\n\r\n1) Someone already found the problem but didn't correct it because he/she was not sure.\r\n2) that both lower hotspots can not have +markerheight and then -marker height should make clear that one of them must be wrong.\r\n3) Lower_Left_Corner is wrong and needs to be -markerHeight",
