But mapsforge doesn't have a MyLocationOverlay, which means we'd need an actual implementation, not just a wrapper. In order to do that, I don't want to have to duplicate everything, but to refactor most of the code out into shared code.\r\n\r\nOn a related subject, I think it would make sense to combine the google wrapper project into the third party project, and also put the mapsforge wrapper in there.",
