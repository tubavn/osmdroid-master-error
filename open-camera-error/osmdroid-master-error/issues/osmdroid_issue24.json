What do you see instead?</b>\nExpected output is a BoundingBoxE6 instance with LatNorth, LatSouth,\r\nLatEast and LatWest attributes correctly set.\r\nInstead: LatNorth and LatSouth values are swapped.\r\nThis is due to incorrect order of minLat and maxLat parameters passed to\r\nthe BoundingBoxE6 constructor - appears to be swapped\r\n\r\n<b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>\nLatest from trunk, as of time of issue submission\r\n\r\n<b>Please provide any additional information below.</b>\n\r\n",
