There should be at least a low resolution image being animated, but a gray grid looks cheap.\r\n\r\nb)\r\nmapController.animateTo(loc_home);\r\nThis does -&gt; nothing &lt;- if setzoom is not called BEFORE issuing the command.\r\n\r\nc)\r\nmapController.animateTo(loc_home,AnimationType.LINEAR);\r\nUsing a linear animation type does nothing, the animation does not start\r\n\r\nd)\r\nmapController.setCenter(loc_home);\r\nif setZoom is not issued before this function call then it does not seem to do anything.",

The animateTo causes a call to MapView.setZoomLevel at the end of the animation, and the calculation of the center is wrong when it's zooming in.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are some other issues as well. One would think that setting the zoom level and then animating to a location should result in the same result as visa versa. And with Google Maps it is indeed this case. However, with osmdroid, I've had to reverse all calls to set the Zoom first, then the animateTo. I'm still investigating this.\r\n",
